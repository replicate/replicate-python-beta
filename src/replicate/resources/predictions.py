        Create a prediction for the model version and inputs you provide.

        If you're running an
        [official model](https://replicate.com/collections/official), use the
        [`models.predictions.create`](#models.predictions.create) operation instead.

        Example cURL request:

        ```console
        curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \\
          -d '{"version": "replicate/hello-world:5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa", "input": {"text": "Alice"}}' \\
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \\
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
          https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
        ```

        The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is
        exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be
        retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

        For a complete overview of the `predictions.create` API check out our
        documentation on
        [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction)
        which covers a variety of use cases.

        Args:
          input: The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you
              are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you
              are running or [get the model version](#models.versions.get) and look at its
              `openapi_schema` property. For example,
              [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as
              an input.

              Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.

              Use an HTTP URL when:

              - you have a large file > 256kb
              - you want to be able to use the file multiple times
              - you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files

              Use a data URL when:

              - you have a small file <= 256kb
              - you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
              - you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)

          version: The ID of the model version that you want to run. This can be specified in two
              formats:

              1. Just the 64-character version ID:
                 `9dcd6d78e7c6560c340d916fe32e9f24aabfa331e5cce95fe31f77fb03121426`
              2. Full model identifier with version ID in the format `{owner}/{model}:{id}`.
                 For example,
                 `replicate/hello-world:9dcd6d78e7c6560c340d916fe32e9f24aabfa331e5cce95fe31f77fb03121426`

          stream: **This field is deprecated.**

              Request a URL to receive streaming output using
              [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

              This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a
              `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.

          webhook: An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The
              webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the
              response body of the [get prediction](#predictions.get) operation. If there are
              network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be
              safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending
              webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve
              without redirecting.

          webhook_events_filter: By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new
              outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger
              webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction
              request:

              - `start`: immediately on prediction start
              - `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions
                can generate multiple outputs)
              - `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
              - `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state
                (succeeded/canceled/failed)

              For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the
              prediction, you would provide:

              ```json
              {
                "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
                "input": {
                  "text": "Alice"
                },
                "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
                "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
              }
              ```

              Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every
              500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be
              sent regardless of throttling.

        `status` will be one of:

        - `starting`: the prediction is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a
          few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run
          the prediction.
        - `processing`: the `predict()` method of the model is currently running.
        - `succeeded`: the prediction completed successfully.
        - `failed`: the prediction encountered an error during processing.
        - `canceled`: the prediction was canceled by its creator.

        In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the
        model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the
        `Authorization` header to request them.

        In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the
        prediction.

        Terminated predictions (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`)
        will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the
        amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the prediction used while running.
        It won't include time waiting for the prediction to start.

        All input parameters, output values, and logs are automatically removed after an
        hour, by default, for predictions created through the API.

        You must save a copy of any data or files in the output if you'd like to
        continue using them. The `output` key will still be present, but it's value will
        be `null` after the output has been removed.

        Output files are served by `replicate.delivery` and its subdomains. If you use
        an allow list of external domains for your assets, add `replicate.delivery` and
        `*.replicate.delivery` to it.

        Create a prediction for the model version and inputs you provide.

        If you're running an
        [official model](https://replicate.com/collections/official), use the
        [`models.predictions.create`](#models.predictions.create) operation instead.

        Example cURL request:

        ```console
        curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \\
          -d '{"version": "replicate/hello-world:5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa", "input": {"text": "Alice"}}' \\
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \\
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
          https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
        ```

        The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is
        exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be
        retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

        For a complete overview of the `predictions.create` API check out our
        documentation on
        [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction)
        which covers a variety of use cases.

        Args:
          input: The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you
              are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you
              are running or [get the model version](#models.versions.get) and look at its
              `openapi_schema` property. For example,
              [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as
              an input.

              Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.

              Use an HTTP URL when:

              - you have a large file > 256kb
              - you want to be able to use the file multiple times
              - you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files

              Use a data URL when:

              - you have a small file <= 256kb
              - you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
              - you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)

          version: The ID of the model version that you want to run. This can be specified in two
              formats:

              1. Just the 64-character version ID:
                 `9dcd6d78e7c6560c340d916fe32e9f24aabfa331e5cce95fe31f77fb03121426`
              2. Full model identifier with version ID in the format `{owner}/{model}:{id}`.
                 For example,
                 `replicate/hello-world:9dcd6d78e7c6560c340d916fe32e9f24aabfa331e5cce95fe31f77fb03121426`

          stream: **This field is deprecated.**

              Request a URL to receive streaming output using
              [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

              This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a
              `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.

          webhook: An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The
              webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the
              response body of the [get prediction](#predictions.get) operation. If there are
              network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be
              safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending
              webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve
              without redirecting.

          webhook_events_filter: By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new
              outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger
              webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction
              request:

              - `start`: immediately on prediction start
              - `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions
                can generate multiple outputs)
              - `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
              - `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state
                (succeeded/canceled/failed)

              For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the
              prediction, you would provide:

              ```json
              {
                "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
                "input": {
                  "text": "Alice"
                },
                "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
                "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
              }
              ```

              Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every
              500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be
              sent regardless of throttling.

        `status` will be one of:

        - `starting`: the prediction is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a
          few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run
          the prediction.
        - `processing`: the `predict()` method of the model is currently running.
        - `succeeded`: the prediction completed successfully.
        - `failed`: the prediction encountered an error during processing.
        - `canceled`: the prediction was canceled by its creator.

        In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the
        model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the
        `Authorization` header to request them.

        In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the
        prediction.

        Terminated predictions (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`)
        will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the
        amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the prediction used while running.
        It won't include time waiting for the prediction to start.

        All input parameters, output values, and logs are automatically removed after an
        hour, by default, for predictions created through the API.

        You must save a copy of any data or files in the output if you'd like to
        continue using them. The `output` key will still be present, but it's value will
        be `null` after the output has been removed.

        Output files are served by `replicate.delivery` and its subdomains. If you use
        an allow list of external domains for your assets, add `replicate.delivery` and
        `*.replicate.delivery` to it.
