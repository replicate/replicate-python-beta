        Note that there is a limit of 1,000 models per account. For most purposes, we
        recommend using a single model and pushing new
        [versions](https://replicate.com/docs/how-does-replicate-work#versions) of the
        model as you make changes to it.

        Args:
          hardware: The SKU for the hardware used to run the model. Possible values can be retrieved
              from the `hardware.list` endpoint.

          name: The name of the model. This must be unique among all models owned by the user or
              organization.

          owner: The name of the user or organization that will own the model. This must be the
              same as the user or organization that is making the API request. In other words,
              the API token used in the request must belong to this user or organization.

          visibility: Whether the model should be public or private. A public model can be viewed and
              run by anyone, whereas a private model can be viewed and run only by the user or
              organization members that own the model.

          cover_image_url: A URL for the model's cover image. This should be an image file.

          description: A description of the model.

          github_url: A URL for the model's source code on GitHub.

          license_url: A URL for the model's license.

        The model object includes the
        [input and output schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi#model-schemas)
        for the latest version of the model.

        Here's an example showing how to fetch the model with cURL and display its input
        schema with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

        ```console
        curl -s \\
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \\
            https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world \\
            | jq ".latest_version.openapi_schema.components.schemas.Input"
        ```

        This will return the following JSON object:

        ```json
        {
          "type": "object",
          "title": "Input",
          "required": ["text"],

              "description": "Text to prefix with 'hello '"
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        The `cover_image_url` string is an HTTPS URL for an image file. This can be:

        - An image uploaded by the model author.
        - The output file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a
          cover image.
        - The input file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a
          cover image and the example prediction has no output file.
        - A generic fallback image.

        The `default_example` object is a [prediction](#predictions.get) created with
        this model.

        The `latest_version` object is the model's most recently pushed
        [version](#models.versions.get).

        Create a prediction using an

        If you're _not_ running an official model, use the
        [`predictions.create`](#predictions.create) operation instead.

        Example cURL request:

        ```console
        curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \\
          -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Write a short poem about the weather."}}' \\

          https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct/predictions
        ```

        The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is
        exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be
        retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

        For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out
        our documentation on
        [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction)
        which covers a variety of use cases.

        Args:
          input: The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you
              are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you
              are running or [get the model version](#models.versions.get) and look at its
              `openapi_schema` property. For example,
              [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as
              an input.

              Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.

              Use an HTTP URL when:

              - you have a large file > 256kb
              - you want to be able to use the file multiple times
              - you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files

              Use a data URL when:

              - you have a small file <= 256kb
              - you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
              - you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)

          stream: **This field is deprecated.**

              Request a URL to receive streaming output using
              [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

              This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a
              `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.

          webhook: An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The
              webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the
              response body of the [get prediction](#predictions.get) operation. If there are
              network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be
              safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending
              webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve
              without redirecting.

          webhook_events_filter: By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new
              outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger
              webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction
              request:

              - `start`: immediately on prediction start
              - `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions
                can generate multiple outputs)
              - `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
              - `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state
                (succeeded/canceled/failed)

              For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the
              prediction, you would provide:

              ```json
              {
                "input": {
                  "text": "Alice"
                },
                "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
                "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
              }
              ```

              Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every
              500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be
              sent regardless of throttling.

        Note that there is a limit of 1,000 models per account. For most purposes, we
        recommend using a single model and pushing new
        [versions](https://replicate.com/docs/how-does-replicate-work#versions) of the
        model as you make changes to it.

        Args:
          hardware: The SKU for the hardware used to run the model. Possible values can be retrieved
              from the `hardware.list` endpoint.

          name: The name of the model. This must be unique among all models owned by the user or
              organization.

          owner: The name of the user or organization that will own the model. This must be the
              same as the user or organization that is making the API request. In other words,
              the API token used in the request must belong to this user or organization.

          visibility: Whether the model should be public or private. A public model can be viewed and
              run by anyone, whereas a private model can be viewed and run only by the user or
              organization members that own the model.

          cover_image_url: A URL for the model's cover image. This should be an image file.

          description: A description of the model.

          github_url: A URL for the model's source code on GitHub.

          license_url: A URL for the model's license.

          paper_url: A URL for the model's paper.

        The model object includes the
        [input and output schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi#model-schemas)
        for the latest version of the model.

        Here's an example showing how to fetch the model with cURL and display its input
        schema with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

        ```console
        curl -s \\
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \\

            | jq ".latest_version.openapi_schema.components.schemas.Input"
        ```

        This will return the following JSON object:

        ```json
        {
          "type": "object",
          "title": "Input",
          "required": ["text"],

            }
          }
        }
        ```

        The `cover_image_url` string is an HTTPS URL for an image file. This can be:

        - An image uploaded by the model author.
        - The output file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a
          cover image.
        - The input file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a
          cover image and the example prediction has no output file.
        - A generic fallback image.

        The `default_example` object is a [prediction](#predictions.get) created with
        this model.

        The `latest_version` object is the model's most recently pushed
        [version](#models.versions.get).

        Create a prediction using an

        If you're _not_ running an official model, use the
        [`predictions.create`](#predictions.create) operation instead.

        Example cURL request:

        ```console
        curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \\
          -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Write a short poem about the weather."}}' \\

          https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct/predictions
        ```

        The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is
        exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be
        retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

        For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out
        our documentation on
        [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction)
        which covers a variety of use cases.

        Args:
          input: The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you
              are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you
              are running or [get the model version](#models.versions.get) and look at its
              `openapi_schema` property. For example,
              [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as
              an input.

              Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.

              Use an HTTP URL when:

              - you have a large file > 256kb
              - you want to be able to use the file multiple times
              - you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files

              Use a data URL when:

              - you have a small file <= 256kb
              - you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
              - you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)

          stream: **This field is deprecated.**

              Request a URL to receive streaming output using
              [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

              This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a
              `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.

          webhook: An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The
              webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the
              response body of the [get prediction](#predictions.get) operation. If there are
              network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be
              safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending
              webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve
              without redirecting.

          webhook_events_filter: By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new
              outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger
              webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction
              request:

              - `start`: immediately on prediction start
              - `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions
                can generate multiple outputs)
              - `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
              - `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state
                (succeeded/canceled/failed)

              For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the
              prediction, you would provide:

              ```json
              {
                "input": {
                  "text": "Alice"
                },
                "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
                "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
              }
              ```

              Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every
